# Rose Pine NvChad Theme

A homage to the beloved Rose Pine NeoVim NvChad theme, this iteration serves as a parallel port, albeit not a direct replication. As my inaugural venture into theme creation and extension, it's a unique interpretation that pays homage to its inspiration while introducing personal touches and adaptations. While it doesn't adhere strictly to a one-to-one replication, it stands as an evolution and expansion of the original concept, crafted with care and creativity.
